## Algorithms in Scala
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ramannanda9/algorithms-in-scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ramannanda9/algorithms-in-scala)

* This repository contains or will contain different algorithms for **searching, sorting, selecting and dynamic programming**.
* This is just an exercise in learning scala.
* And recognizing the shortcomings of not having pass by reference.
* You will find use of **context bounds** and **type classes** for ex: `Ordering[K]`
* Tests are written in **ScalaTest**
* To run the tests just use `gradle test`
* Readme maybe present for some dynamic programming problems, use a compatible Markdown Previewer to view the equations. 
For example: VSCode or Atom.
